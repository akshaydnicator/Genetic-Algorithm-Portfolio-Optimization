The purpose of this project was to determine optimum weights of assets in a given investment portfolio using *Genetic Algorithm*. In this case, *Sharpe ratio* was used as a **fitness function** with an aim to maximize the returns while minimizing the risk at the same time. **Heuristic Crossover and Arithmetic Crossover** techniques were employed for comparison along with a varying probability of **Mutation** for every new generation during each iteration. Finally, the set of asset weights which resulted in maximum expected portfolio return and minimum expected portfolio risk (standard deviation) was selected by optimizing the fitness function.
